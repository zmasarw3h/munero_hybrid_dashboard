# Copy this file to `./.env.caddy` (gitignored) and fill in real values.
# IMPORTANT: keep the bcrypt hash exactly as generated (single `$`, not `$$`).
#
# Recommended: set a plaintext password here and the container will generate a
# bcrypt hash at startup (avoids `$...` escaping issues in env files).
#
# Optional: you can set `BASIC_AUTH_HASH` directly instead, but you may need to
# escape `$` characters as `$$` depending on your Compose version/settings.
