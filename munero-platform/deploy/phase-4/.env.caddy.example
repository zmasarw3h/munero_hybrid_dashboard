# Caddy Basic Auth (service-only)
#
# Copy this file to `./.env.caddy` (gitignored) and fill in real values.
# IMPORTANT: keep the bcrypt hash exactly as generated (single `$`, not `$$`).
#
# Recommended: set a plaintext password here and the container will generate a
# bcrypt hash at startup (avoids `$...` escaping issues in env files).
#
# Optional: you can set `BASIC_AUTH_HASH` directly instead, but you may need to
# escape `$` characters as `$$` depending on your Compose version/settings.

# Fill these in on the target environment.
# Suggested permissions on the VM: `chmod 600 .env.caddy`
BASIC_AUTH_USER=
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=

# Optional alternative (advanced):
# Set the bcrypt hash directly (leave BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD empty).
# BASIC_AUTH_HASH=
